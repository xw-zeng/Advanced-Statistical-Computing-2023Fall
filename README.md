## Few-shot Image Classification for Breast Cancer Detection

- **Background:** Breast cancer is a pressing concern worldwide, ranking as the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Early detection and identification of breast cancer can lead to timely treatment, effectively reducing the risk of further deterioration or death <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21731">[Miller et al. 2022]</a>.
